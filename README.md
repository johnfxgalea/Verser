# Verser
The collaboration of IoT devices provides sophisticated automation which is beneficial to users. Typically, devices offer services to each other that expose their capabilities in interacting with their physical environments, via machine-to-machine communication. However, there is little assurance that these devices are capable of operating their services. In this work, we propose **Verser**, a novel cryptographic protocol which aims to verify capabilities that are based on actuators and sensors of IoT devices. The approach consists of challenging devices to operate their services, and checking results with their owners or other capable devices connected to the network. We present a security analysis of the protocol, based on a defined threat model. Our approach seems promising according to experimental results obtained using an initial prototype.
